# Instructions

## General Info
First of all, thank you for volunteering in our study. We are researching how we, as humans, compare information from different modalities. This will be studied by measuring response times to textual and visual stimuli.

## Description of Tasks
There are two steps to each trial you will see:

1. First you will be presented with a simple statement describing a relationship between two shapes. Take as much time as you need to read, understand, and memorize the statement, then press any key to continue.
  * E.g. **The circle is above the square.**
2. The statement will go away, and will be replaced by an image with two shapes. Your job is to determine as quickly and accurately as possible whether the image is consistent with the statement you just saw (i.e. whether the sentence accurately describes the image). As soon as you have decided, press '***C***' to indicate it is ***consistent***, or press '***N***' to indicate it is ***not consistent***.
  * E.g. <img src="img/square.png"></img><br><br><img src="img/circle.png"></img>
  * You would press '***N***' because the statement above does *not* accurately describe the image.

## Details

* There will be **four practice trials** before you begin the experiment.
* The experiment itself will consist of **16 real trials**.
* If you are interrupted during the experiment and are unable to finish, feel free to restart the experiment by visiting the page again. Data is not saved to the server until the experiment is complete and the "Thank you for participating" page is displayed.

## Your Rights

The results collected are for academic purposes only.  No identifying information will be collected and there is no penalty for exiting the study at any time.
