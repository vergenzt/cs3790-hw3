# Instructions
<div id="directions">
###General Info
First of all, thank you for volunteering in our study. To preview why you are here, let me explain our research. We are interested in how we, as humans, compare information in different modalities which will be tested as described in the next section. 

###Description of Tasks
There are two steps to each trial you will see:

1. First you will be presented with a simple statement that you will need to memorize for the next step. **There is no rush, please take as long as you need**.
  * Ex: The circle is above the square. 
2. Next you will be presented an image that cooresponds to the statement you just read. It is your job to indicate whether the pictures are consistent with what we said in that statement. Please make your decision as quickly and accurately as possible.
  * You will make your selection by strinking either the **'C' (Consistent: if the statement accurately described the image)** or **'N' (Not Consistent: if the statement and the image were contradictory)** keys on your keyboard. *This instruction will remain visibile during the testing in case you forget*.

###Your Rights

The results collected are for academic purposes only.  No identifying information will be collected and there is no penalty for exiting the study at any time.
